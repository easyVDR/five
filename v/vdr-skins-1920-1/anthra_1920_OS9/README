Latest version available at: http://justlinux.de/vdr/

Description: anthra_SD-skin is a dark, anthracite skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR (http://www.tvdr.de/).

The resolution of the skin is 720x576 and it is not scalable.

Users with FullHD- or HD-Ready-capable hardware should have a look at anthra-Full-HD and anthra-HD-Ready-skins

e.g. http://vdrportal.de/board/thread.php?threadid=99886

anthra_SD-skin is designed to work with softdecoders like vdr-xine and xineliboutput - both preferred with vdpau - 
but it is also succesfully tested with eHD-cards.

The skin will not work with Fullfeaturd-DVB-Cards with only original (2MB) memory
and DXR3-Cards.

Fullfeaturd-DVB-Cards with extended memory (modded) should be tested.
