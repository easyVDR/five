Description:

	anthra_HD-skin is a dark, anthracite skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR (http://www.tvdr.de/).

	The resolution of the skin is 1920x1080 and it is not scalable.


	anthra_HD-skins are designed to work with softdecoders like vdr-xine and xineliboutput - both preferred with vdpau.

		!!!only usable with current git-version or patch by NemoN@vdrportal!!!

		For German broadcasting corporations channellogos
		designed by Oliver Ranke (liquidolze@vdrportal.de) are available.

		and rebuild the skinfile 
	
		
	4. SEPARATORLOGOS
	    SEPARATORLOGOSPATH
	   
	     For group separators in channels.conf you can download a small package via
	     
	     wget http://justlinux.de/vdr/Separatorlogos.tar.gz
	     
	     Be aware that the string of your separator in channels.conf and the filename of
	     the corresponding logofile must be identic as well as channelnames and channel-logos.
