Description:

	anthra_HD-skin is a dark, anthracite skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR (http://www.tvdr.de/).

	The resolution of the skin is 1920x1080 and it is not scalable.


	anthra_HD-skins are designed to work with softdecoders like vdr-xine and xineliboutput - both preferred with vdpau.


1. Requirements:

	a. text2skin, latest GIT-Version:
	
		 git clone git://projects.vdr-developer.org/vdr-plugin-text2skin.git
	
		initially developed by Sascha Volkenandt - now it is a community maintained project
		
		text2skin should be compiled with
		
		IMAGELIB = graphicsmagick
		DEVELOPMENT_FEATURES = 1
		
		both can be set in Makefile of text2skin
	
	b. VDRSymbols.ttf
	
		by Andreas Mair
		
		http://andreas.vdr-developer.org/fonts/download/vdrsymbols-ttf-20100612.tgz
	
	
2. The *.po files for the translations of *Volume* and *Mute* are taken from
	VDR-sources. Thanks a lot to all translators and especially to
	Klaus Schmidinger for developing VDR !
	
3. Make.config settings:

		To rebuild skinfile with changed settings run in /path/to/anthra_1920_FSE/
		be aware, that gettext is installed!
		
		make clean all

			EPGIMAGESFORMAT = #e.g. jpg
			RECORDINGIMAGENAME = #e.g. thumbnail 
			
			EVENTID=`cat $2/info | sed -n -e 's/^E //p'| awk -F " " '{print $1 }'`

			if [ -f $EPGIMAGESPATH/$EVENTID.jpg ]; then
