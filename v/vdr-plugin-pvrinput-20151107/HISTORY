VDR Plugin 'pvrinput' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2012-12-01 (Dr. Seltsam)
- use radiofd for control the radio device

2011-08-18 (mini73)
- support SignalStrength of cDevice in vdr 1.7.19

2011-02-12 (mini73)
- add support for hotplug with the dynamite plugin

2010-09-01 (mini73)
- use helper class for protected crc-function of libsi
- update of italian translations (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- use select with timeout on reader so a hanging device doesn't
  crash the vdr
- integrate submenu-patches of rblickle
- send right PES header on teletext packets
- fix vbi-mode handling on opening the device

2010-03-27-rc1 (mini73)
- rework teletext handling so no retuning is needed
- add script for conversion of plugin-param-patch-channels to
  new vdr syntax with source 'V'
- update README

1.7.1-rc1-9 (mini73)
- send no video packets for radio channels
- fix teletext descriptor in PMT
- add setup value TsBufferSizeMB for size of ringbuffer
- add setup value TsBufferPrefillRatio: the ringbuffer
  can be filled before the plugin deliveres the data to vdr
- set the right SID and TID at the PAT/PMT
- add sectionhandler for filters
- add new source-parameter handler for 'V' (analog video)
- frequency will be passed to externchannelswitch.sh since
  the SID should be 1

1.7.0-rc9 (Dr. Seltsam)
- remove PvrSetup.Pvrusb2StopOnChange as there is a
  driver solution now available
- fix exception handling for PVR500 (volume, useOnlyCard)
- don't write INVALID_VALUE in setup.conf.
  This fixes zero values if no device is present
- update README
- fix initial Video Size setting by using driver default
- fix handling of PAL_60 
- fix ProvidesChannel: no longer switch between pvr devices
  when zapping while osdteletxt is running

1.7.0-rc8 (mini73)
- add support for the Hauppauge HD PVR

1.7.0-rc7 (mini73)
- embed PAT, PMT and PCR into the transport stream

1.7.0-rc6 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fix ProvidesChannel()  (thanks to Wirbel)
- add possibility to use an externchannelswitch.sh script
  (see README). 

1.7.0-rc4+rc5: only for selected testers with additional debug stuff

1.7.0-rc3 (Dr. Seltsam)
- improve error log messages
- fix possible race condition in OpenDvr

1.7.0-rc2 (Dr. Seltsam)
- remove bool isTuning, because it seems to result in problems in few cases.
  As tuning is done in OpenDvr, it is no more necessary anyway.
- remove outcommented code in reader.c, was a leftover from tests

1.7.0-rc1 (Dr. Seltsam)
- add support for cx18-based devices
- various small bugfixes
- restruct OpenDvr/CloseDvr. We stop and start
  the encoder now here and also execute the driver commands for channel
  switching.
- start readThread not at plugin start, but at first OpenDvr() call
- fix initialize value of v4l2_fd in Probe()
- also log error number in Tune()
- remove check for driver name IVTV, as it is "ivtv" since a long time
- improve detecting if read thread exists by using the new bool
  readThreadRunning
- remove unused bool stop in reader.c
- reader.c: use parent->v4l2_fd instead of int video_fd and int VideoDevice
- extend logging - now also write into syslog
- add NumProvidedSystems for vdr 1.7.x
- common.c: fix checking if device is open. If not, log an error
- fix translation of "pvr picture settings" and plugin description
- Fix a bug in PesToTS which wrote a wrong Pid in the header. This was a major
  bug which prevented  vdr 1.7 from working with pvrinput
- repeat read access in Action() three times before abort
- remove support for old channels syntax (CAID A1). Show an OSD error message
  in case the old syntax is found
- allow V4L2_MPEG_STREAM_TYPE_MPEG2_DVD for DVD-compatible streams (see README)
- rename plugin.c/h to pvrinput.c/h
- check vbi capabilities
- PesToTs cannot handle all vbi data, only Teletext. Therefore only embedd
  V4L2_SLICED_TELETEXT_B into the mpeg stream. This makes channel switching
  faster
- allow usage of different video sub standards like SECAM-D/K, PAL-D/K etc.
  by using more parameters in channels.conf
- when using a PVR350, automatically stop the decoder before switching the
  video standard. This avoids EBUSY errors in case of a race condition
  (pvrinput may be faster than the pvr350-plugin)
- An exception audio level can be set for certain cards (see README)
- fix gcc 4.3 compiler warnings
- change default log level to 2, as to much debug messages
  increase channel switching time
- mute audio for pvrusb2 devices while switching channels in case
  "PVRUSB2 Stop on Change" is set to no.
- remove setting of separate video bitrate for radio recordings. (With new
  version of pvr350-plugin it is no longer necessary to use VPID 301
  (video stream) for radio)

2009-01-24 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fix frequency of k09 in channels.conf examples
  (thanks to panik105 from vdrportal)


2008-12-24 (Dr. Seltsam)
- The previous fix in cPluginPvrInput::MainMenuAction must depend on
  PLUGINPARAMPATCHVERSNUM. Oherwise it does not compile with a vdr version
  that is not patched with the pluginparam-patch
- fix frequency of S30 in channels.conf examples, add S29 and S35

2008-10-26 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fix usage of PvrMenuMain on channels with iptv-syntax
- fix permission of directories
- remove executable flag from patches and conf files
- fix Makefile


2008-10-03 (Dr. Seltsam)
- add possibility to force the plugin to use only a certain card by using the 
  new value PvrSetup.UseOnlyCard. (see README)
- update README
- add vdr-1.7.0-pluginparam.patch

2008-09-14 (Dr. Seltsam)
- remove usage of vbi device, as it is not needed for sliced vbi
- remove unused bool dvrOpen

2008-09-13 (Wirbel)
- further work on future support of HVR 1300
- fix radio detecting
- remove PvrSetup.UseDeviceType

2008-09-04 (Dr. Seltsam)
- move and simplify the check for radio presence from SetChannelDevice to
  ProvidesChannel.
- updated italian language file (thanks to Diego Pierotto)
- Stop VBI sliced mode when plugin stops. This avoids full ivtv vbi buffers.
- implement a new method to detect the matching radio device

2008-06-23 (Wirbel)
- moved sysfx fix to patches - we need a better solution here, not using /sys at all.
- moved channel validity checks to ProvidesChannel
- ParseChannel now also gets Pointer to card
- ParseChannel (old syntax): if no input was given -> default to TV input
- ParseChannel change *only* vars given by pointer, don't access global vars directly.
- ParseChannel log output now only for pvrinput channels.  
- ProvidesChannel now calls ParseChannel to check wether a channel can be switched to
- changed debug output of tune (readability)
- updated README (description of new channel syntax)

2008-07-05 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fix handling of CARD-parameter (thanks to mgoeben from vdrportal for reporting
  the problem, and to Wirbel for telling me how to solve it :-) )
- extend log info for SetChannelDevice and ProvidesChannel (add number of device)
- don't allow tuning to a radio channel if device has no radio
  (avoids endless "Can start transfer mode" loop)
- increase number of kMaxPvrDevices to 8 (vdr also increased the maximum number
  of DVB devices to 8 in vdr 1.5.1)

2008-06-19 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fix setting of Tuner Audio Mode 

2008-06-01 (Dr. Seltsam)
- added a patch from <christian.jarczyk@freenet.de> for improved autodetection
  of ivtv radio devices. As it is only rarely tested, the patch is optional.
  Uncomment "#define SYSFS_FIX" in device.c if you want to try it.
- update README and HISTORY
- update example channels.conf files
- add patches for pvrusb2 driver
- start with a FAQ

2008-05-28 (Dr. Seltsam)
- fixed a bug in ParseChannel. Now the external inputs work also with the 
  new channelssyntax.

2008-05-24 (Dr. Seltsam)
- added a lot of patches from Wirbel (improve log messages, simplify code,
  prepare for further support of cx88-blackbird devices)
- fix errors in *.po files


2008-05-14 (Dr. Seltsam)
- Starting with this version, the plugin now supports devices using the
  pvrusb2 driver. It has been successfully tested with a Hauppauge PVRUSB2
  Model 29034 Rev. C547. For details see README
- all include files are now in common.h
- separate reader.c/h files for cPvrReadThread
- Delete the readThread for every device now in cPvrDevice::Stop() instead of
  deleting it later in the destructor.
  This avoids full ivtv buffer and hopefully improves the shutdown handling.
- GetTSPacket(): check if tsBuffer and readThread are existing
- Fix "race condition" while deleting threads which could cause a segfault
  (patch by andreas_schaefers@gmx.de)
- additional and extended log messages
- allow setting of Tuner Audio Mode to be able to record bilingual recordings
  with both languages
- improve Tune() using same code as in v4l2-ctl
- using -fPic in Makefile
- change test method in Makefile whether VDR has locale support
- fix enless loop "Can start transfer mode" when switching to a not
  existing input. The message still appears, but it is now possible to switch
  to another channel. (vdr will automatically return to the last channel
  after 2 minutes)
- update README
- update channels.conf.sample, includes now radio


2007-11-01 (Wirbel + Dr.Seltsam):
- Makefile changed, i18n.{c,h} removed, now gettext internationalization
- TEST: new function ParseChannel and adapted SetChannelDevice for testing
  pluginparampatch Syntax
- removed cPvrReadThread::ResetCounters(void),
  cPvrReadThread::SetPaused (int set), PvrSetup.DelayAfterTune and
  PvrSetup.Force_Encoder_Stop_Start. They are no longer needed, because we now
  always delete the readThread and stop/start the encoder when switching
  channels.
- removed unused ePause and eResume in SetEncoderState.
- introduced PvrSetup.SliceVBI which allows to turn off embedding VBI
  (Teletext) data into the mpeg.
  This could improve stability if you don`t use the osdteletxt-Plugin and have
  problems with full ivtv buffers.
  Changing the setting will take effect after a restart.
- Newer ivtv drivers don`t allow changing some settings 
        V4L2_CID_MPEG_AUDIO_SAMPLING_FREQ
        V4L2_CID_MPEG_AUDIO_L2_BITRATE
        V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE_MODE
        V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE
        V4L2_CID_MPEG_VIDEO_BITRATE_PEAK
  while the encoder is running. Each time you change settings in the plugin
  setup, we now repeat all settings once after the next encoder stop (= during
  next channel switch) 
- introduced PvrSetup.VideoBitrateFM and renamed PvrSetup.VideoBitrate to
  PvrSetup.VideoBitrateTV.
  Different bitrates allow us to avoid unnecessary large files when recording
  from radio (see also README).
- removed unnecessary "typedef enum" in setup.h


2007-09-02 (Dr. Seltsam):
- adapted plugin to recent ivtv driver changes. Changing the VBI format,
  video norm, input or tuner band requires now an encoder stop/start.
  Basically this is nothing else than the "AntiFlickering workaround" did
  before (by closing and re-opening the device), so I also renamed it
  to "Force encoder stop/start".
- moved Clearing of tsBuffer from OpenDvr to SetChannelDevice.
  (If a timer starts while you watch a recording, vdr tunes to the desired
  channel without calling OpenDvr.)
- a default value of 20 ms for DelayAfterTune seems to be sufficient
- added a recommendation in README for PVR350 users to enable
  "Force encoder stop/start"
- update README


2007-05-10 .. 2007-05-23 (Wirbel):

- tried to simplify controls (QueryAllControls, SetControlValue)
- SetControlValue is now overloaded function
- separate valSet for FM radio Audio Volume instead of int type
- added cPlugin::Stop() which stops all threads, see <vdr>/PLUGINS.html
- added preliminary Patch for vdr-1.5.2 (later 1.5 Versions may need 
  some small adaptions inside channels.conf and plugins source code)
- new function SetVBImode()
- fixed internationalization for setup page and mainpage
- cPvrReadThread::Action() is now checking Running as needed
  (see <vdr>/threads.h)
- added cPvrReadThread::ResetCounters(void)
- cPvrReadThread::PesToTs and cPvrReadThread::ParseProgramStream
  sligthly changed
- FM Radio now initialized in cPvrDevice::cPvrDevice
- new property IVTV_apiversion gives ivtv version number
- cPvrDevice::Probe rewritten
- cPvrDevice::OpenDvr now resets all counters: audio, video, text
- several other improvements
- fix: 'Channel no available' during records from ext inputs
- channels with frequency 87500 .. 108000 (87.5MHz .. 108MHz) are now
  considered as FM radio, regardless of their VPID.
- thanks to DrSeltsam for excessive testing


2007:

- added a first version of romanian i18n (Lucian Muresan
<lucianm AT users DOT sourceforge DOT net>)
- re-added main menu control, because it's useful and yet
optional (Lucian Muresan <lucianm AT users DOT sourceforge DOT net>)
-removed 3.2 pulldown stuff because it was removed in driver
-Code Cleanup by Andreas Schaefers
-fix and improve radio (thanx to Jose Alberto Reguero
 <jareguero@telefonica.net> )
-smoother channel switching: use encoder pause before tuning and resume after
 tuner has fully locked. Thererfore the time between tuning and encoder resume
 can be set in the menu (WaitAfterTuning). Default value is 50ms.

2006-11-21:
-added "Anti-Flickering workaround" in the plugin menu. If set to "yes", it
 will close and re-open the device at each channel switch. This has been tested
 as being a reliably workaround for the flickering problem that some people
 have been reported. (see also
 http://www.vdr-portal.de/board/thread.php?threadid=52013 and
 http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/ivtv/devel/33101 ). Default is "no"
 The Flickering is solved in newer drivers for cx23416-based cards, but still
 exist for cx23415 (PVR350 and older revisions of PVR250) 

2006-10-08 (Wirbel):

- removed all old ivtv API calls and switched to v4l2 (some of them already
  were v4l2 api)
- removed ivtv.h and videodev2.h
- removed the main menu entry, because it was easier to realize
- added internationalization (english and german are done, other
  languages not done but prepared)
- improved video filter settings

2006-02-09: Version 0.1.1

- fixed detection of pvr card to work with ivtv version 0.4.1 or later with
kernel 2.4.


2005-11-27: Version 0.1.0

- fixed detection of pvr card to work with ivtv version 0.4.1 or later.


2005-11-27: Version 0.0.9

- adapted setting of VBI mode to new API used in driver version 0.4.0.
- removed dynamic setting of VBI embedded mode as this doesn't work when the
video device is opened.


2005-09-04: Version 0.0.8

- Fixed setting of vbi modes.


2005-09-04: Version 0.0.7

- It is possible to hide the main menu entry through a setting in setup menu.
- The time to wait for the ringbuffer to fill with data is now adjustable in
  setup menu.
- Now using embedded vbi mode only when the channel has a valid teletext PID.
  If the PID is 0 then embedded vbi mode is disabled.


2005-08-28: Version 0.0.6

- Added setting of vbi teletext mode. Now it should work again with 0.2 and
  0.3 drivers.
- Removed dependency from libdvb from makefile.
- Added a small OSD window for setting up the picture parameters (brightness,
  contrast, saturation, hue). It can be reached from the main menu.


2005-08-27: Version 0.0.5

- Fixed: memcpy length in last TS packet was wrong (thanks to Christian
  Cier-Zniewski for reporting).
- Made PES to TS conversion MPEG compliant, stuffing in last TS packet is now
  done with adaptaion field. (thanks to Christian Cier-Zniewski for reporting).
- Static variables of PET to TS conversion are now non-static members of
  cPvrReadThread. This is needed for multiple card support.
- Fixed: not switching to new channel when recording starts during watching
  another analogue channel.


2005-08-26: Version 0.0.4

- Switched to a self-written PES to TS conversion. libdvb is no longer needed.
- Now using vbi embedded mode for reading the teletext data.
- fixed closing the radio device when switching to a non-tuner input (thanks
  to Jose Alberto Reguero).
- Waiting for buffer to fill in GetTsPacket. This speeds up the "hopping" over
  channels. You can change the kTimeToWaitAfterChannelSwitch value to change
  the time to wait. 1000 works good for me and slows down things not too much.
- renewed ivtv.h to be compatible with ivtv 0.3 versions.


2005-07-23: Version 0.0.3

- Settings taken in setup menu are now applied after leaving it with OK
- Now reading video and vbi data in one and the same thread. I hope
  this improves things a bit.
- Now immediately returns in SetChannelDevice when the channel is already set.
- Only reading from vbi device if opening was successful (thanks to steffx
  for reporting this one).


2005-06-13: Version 0.0.2

- The tuner input is now auto-detected (I hope this works for non
  PVR-250 cards).
- Added support for other inputs than the tuner, using the "C" parameter
  of the channel entry. I did not test this here, it should work.
- Fixed VIDIOC_G_FMT ioctl.
- Added support for the video norms NTSC, SECAM and PAL, using the "I"
  parameter of the channel entry.
- Added support for radio channels, the video PID must be set to zero.
  I can't test this here, I hope it works.
- Added setup menu for setting up encoding parameters.
- Added videodev2.h file from the ivtv driver archive.


2005-05-31: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
