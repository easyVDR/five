_Description: Try to automatically load the evdev module?
 Enable this, if you want a setup which automatically loads the evdev module,
 needed by the remote-plugin.
 .
 This script will try to load the module evdev and, if this is successful, 
 it will add a new entry for evdev to your /etc/modules.
 .
 If this fails, your kernel maybe does not have evdev support, and you will
 need to rebuild your kernel with the CONFIG_INPUT_EVDEV option enabled.

Type: note
_Description: Error loading evdev module
 The evdev module could not be loaded, probably your kernel has builtin-support
 for evdev, or your kernel is missing evdev support.
