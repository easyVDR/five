vdradmin-am (3.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The auto timer functionality in VDRAdmin-AM will probably be dropped in future
  versions (See upstream changelog for details). Autotimers will then be done with
  the EPGSearch plugin. See README.Debian for details on how to move your auto
  timer settings to the EPGSearch plugin

vdradmin (0.96-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The most important change in this release is that vdradmin from 
  now on will run under the username vdradmin, not as root, the 
  configfiles will be changed at installation, so they are owned by 
  the user and group vdradmin.

  We also changed the path of the files vdradmind.conf and vdradmind.at
  from /etc/vdradmin/ to /var/lib/vdradmin both files will be moved to 
  the new directory when they allready exist. The symlink 
  /etc/vdradmin/vdradmind.conf will be created so will find the cfgfile
  still under /etc/vdradmin.
