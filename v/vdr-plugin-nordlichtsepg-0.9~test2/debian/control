Description: Nordlicht's EPG for VDR
 This plugin provides an EPG (Electronic Program Guide) similar to VDR's
 "What's on now?"-menu. Unlike this it also shows channels without epg-infos.
 You can browse the epg with an adjustable step width. It is also possible to
 set a time at the setup to which you can jump by keypress, with the keys 1-7
 you can jump 1-7 days forward. A bargraph at the "What's on now?"-view shows
 the progress of the running program. Timers are marked with a clock-icon,
 recording timers with a 'REC'-icon. It is possible, also for channels without
 epg-infos, to set timers.
