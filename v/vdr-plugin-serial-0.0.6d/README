Description:
This plugin allows using a homebrew frontpanel as a remote control for 
VDR. For details see circuit.jpg.
To use the plugin your homebrew frontpanel has to be connected to your 
serial Port.

When the plugin is loaded for the first time, vdr will prompt you to
learn the keys of the hombrew frontpanel.
