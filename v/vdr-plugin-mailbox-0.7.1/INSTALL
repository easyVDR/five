Installation notes for the Mailbox-plugin and c-client-library
==============================================================

This file contains some information about installing the Mailbox-plugin
for VDR and the c-client-library.

Unfortunately there are significant differences on how the various Linux-
distributors build their packages and the author is not able to test all
these distributions himself.

If you are using a distribution which isn't mentioned in this release, use
a newer version of a mentioned distribution or if you find some errors or
inaccuracies in the following description please send an e-mail to the author
containing the following information:

- Linux distribution and version number
- c-client package name and version (or compiled from source)
- used settings for IMAPINCDIR and IMAPLFLAGS

Most of the following distribution dependent notes are outdated. Therefore
the author needs your feedback to provide up-to-date information.

Thank you for your support!

1. General notes
================

The Mailbox-plugin relies on c-client-library to access the mail accounts
on the server.

The plugin was developed with version 2007e of the library. Other versions
weren't tested by the author an may or may not work with the plugin.

To install the necessary header- and library-files you could use (in most
cases) the packages of your distribution. If this is not possible you will
have to compile c-client yourself.

Note: The plugin needs the c-client-library and headers; there is no need
to install the UW IMAP server on your VDR PC.

The Makefile of the Mailbox-plugin expects two variables pointing to the
place where the c-client-files are located and the linker flags needed
for the c-client library.

These two variables are:

  IMAPINCDIR
  IMAPLFLAGS

You could set these variables in the Makefile of the plugin or in the
Make.config in the root directory of VDR. If you set the variables in
Make.config you do not have to modify the plugin Makefile each time
you install a new version of the plugin.

2. Distribution notes
=====================
2.1 Gentoo
----------

Simply emerge "net-lib/c-client" and set the variables to the following 
values:

 IMAPINCDIR ?= /usr/include/imap
 IMAPLFLAGS ?= -lc-client
  
These are the default values in the Makefile

2.2 Ubuntu/Debian
-----------------

Install the package "libc-client2007e-dev" and set the variables to 
the follwing values:

 IMAPINCDIR ?= /usr/include/c-client
 IMAPLFLAGS ?= -lc-client

3. Installation of the plugin
=============================

If you set the two variables in the file Make.config in the VDR directory
the plugin can be installed like any other plugin:

$ cd $VDRDIR/PLUGINS/src
$ tar xzf vdr-mailbox-<version>.tgz
$ ln -s mailbox-<version> mailbox

$ cd $VDRDIR
$ make plugins


4.  Troubleshooting
===================
4.1   Compilation
-----------------
4.1.1   "linkage.c" not found
-----------------------------
The compiler complains about a missing file "linkage.c" while compiling the
plugin.

The file "linkage.c" is generated during the build-process of the c-client
library and therefore depends on the configuration during the build-process.

If the binary/development package of your distribution doesn't contain
"linkage.c" you will have to install c-client from sources.

4.2 Execution
-------------
4.2.1 unresolved externals when starting VDR with the plugin
------------------------------------------------------------
If you get an unresolved external error when starting VDR with the plugin
you will have to add some libraries to the IMAPLFLAGS variable.

vdr[..]: loading plugin: /usr/../VDR/PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-mailbox.so.1.4.0
vdr[..]: ERROR: /usr/../VDR/PLUGINS/lib/libvdr-mailbox.so.1.4.0: undefined symbol: <symbolname>

If <symbolname> is
- 'crypt' -> add '-lcrypt' to IMAPLDFLAGS

4.2.2 if plugin isn't able to connect to the mail-account
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are using gentoo or ubuntu please install the package "uw-mailutils"
and test the connection with "mailutil" until you found the correct settings
and use them in the plugin.
