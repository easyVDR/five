VDR Plugin 'Mailbox' Revision History
--------------------------------------

2014-10-26: Version 0.7.1

- All OsdMenus now set the MenuCategory - hopefully the correct ones :)

- Modified the OsdMenu/MenuHelpKeys header-/inline files to work with
  newer gcc-compilers and makes plugin-compiler-flag "-O2" obsolete

- Removed -O2 compiler option

- Added mailbox-gtft.patch to improve cooperation with the Graphtft(Ng)
  plugin by adding the method MenuKind() to all OSD menus
  (patch provided by Jörg Wendel)

2013-03-21: Version 0.7.0

- Adapted Makefile for vdr >= 1.7.41.
  For vdr <= 1.7.33 use vdr-mailbox-0.6.0.
  The plugin may not work for versions between 1.7.33 and 1.7.41.

- removed vdr-version dependent compilation: starting with
  version 0.7.0 the plugin is only tested with vdr >= 1.7.41

- Added compiler option -O2 to the Makefile to avoid "undefined 
  symbol: Ax::VDR::OsdMenuBase<cOsdMenu>::clearStatusMsg()"
  when starting vdr

- code cleanup to remove some compiler warnings and to adapt 
  coding conventions
  
- cache the texts of the color buttons and status messages

- Disabled some debug output

- Updated Italian language texts
  (Thanks to Diego Pierotto, 2008-08-15)

2008-08-15: Version 0.6.0

- License: included GPL note "v2 or any later" to README.

- Restricted the maximum interval for the background check to 35 minutes
  due to a bug in GetAbsTime() in vdr-1.4.7, 1.6.0 and 1.7.0.

  If the interval for the background check was set to an interval of
  36 minutes or more, the plugin caused high cpu-load and hangup of vdr.

  If the bug was corrected in vdr *OR* the patch vdr-1.6.0-GetAbsTime-fix.diff
  in the patches subdirectory was applied to the sources of vdr, the
  usable interval may be increased with the parameter "-i <maxtime>".

- Pressing key 'Info' (or key '0' as before) displays online help for
  key mappings.

- Added Italian language texts
  (Thanks to Diego Pierotto)

- Added setup option for mail accounts of type INBOX which refers to
  the primary incoming message mailbox on the local system.
  Note: Selecting account type INBOX is equivalent to selecting type
  "User defined" and using "INBOX" as mailbox-string.

- Mail accounts of type "User defined" may be used without a user name.
  (Reported by Torsten Weigelt)

- Fixed saving the connection timeout to setup.conf.

2007-11-17: Version 0.5.2-pre3

- Added service call "MailBox-GetTotalUnseen-1.0"

2007-10-28: Version 0.5.2-pre2

- In mail-view the key '8' displays all parts of MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE
  mails.

2007-10-25: Version 0.5.2-pre1

- Pass the source of HTML-only mails to an external program to convert
  HTML to plain text and display the result.
  For mails with MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE only plain text parts are displayed.

  The plugin must be started with parameter '-c /path/to/mailconv.sh'; see
  README for further information.

2007-10-21: Version 0.5.0

- Added support for the new i18n system of vdr >= 1.5.7

- Check the used charset with cCharSetConv::SystemCharacterTable() when
  using vdr >= 1.5.3

- Added French language texts
  (thanks to Patrice Staudt)

- Added call to cStatus::MsgOsdTextItem to make the message body visible
  with graphlcd/graphtft.

- Added call cStatus::MsgOsdTextItem() whenn scolling up/down in mail-view.

- Added workaround for imap-servers not reporting attribute "charset=.."
  in "Content-Type:" lines. If charset is missing ISO-8859-1 is used.

2006-06-11: Version 0.4.0

- Version 0.4.0 released

2006-06-10: Version 0.4.0-pre3

- Added a remark about the required version of the c-client-library to the
  INSTALL file:

  Version 2004 of the c-client library is required. The plugin was developed
  with version 2004a of the library (contained in imap-2004a.tar.Z). The
  current version 2004g may work too, but was not tested by the author.

- Added option to mail account settings to specify if new mails in the mail
  account should influence the state delivered by the internal service call
  which could be used e.g. to display a mail icon in replay and channel info.

- Allow ':' in the hostname of mail accounts.

- Added '-fPIC' to CXXFLAGS in Makefile
  (Suggested by Thomas Günther)

- Fixed a bug which was introduced in pre2 which caused the background
  thread to display the message "New mail in XXX, open?" after every check.
  (Reported by Thomas Günther)

2006-06-05: Version 0.4.0-pre2

- Developed and tested with vdr-1.4.0 with Gentoo-Linux/gcc-3.4.6

- Update the color buttons when selecting another mail according
  to the status flags.

- Avoid some warnings about missing translations for the keys 0..9
  in the help screen.

- The setting of vdr 'OSDMessageTime' is now used as the time to display
  the osd message "new mail in ..., open?".
  (Suggested by Ronny Kornexl)

- Fixed some issues with gcc 3.2
  (Thanks to Stephan Sachse for providing the patch)

2006-05-20: Version 0.4.0-pre1

- Developed and tested with vdr-1.4.0 with Gentoo-Linux/gcc-3.4.5

- Adopted changes to the Makefile as required since vdr-1.3.47

- Added a service-call "MailBox-HasNewMail-1.0" to allow other plugins
  to query if there is at least one new mail present.
  This call doesn't query the mail accounts at the mail server, instead
  it simply returns the currently known status for those accounts which
  have enabled the periodic check.
  There will be a patch for the Elchi-skin to use this call to
  (optionally) display a mail icon in the replay and channel info.

- Added a new configuration option to the common settings to setup the
  connection timeout. A value of 0 uses the system default. A reasonable
  value would be somewhat smaller than the watchdog timeout of vdr
  (option -w when starting vdr). The default setting is 0.

- Added new configuration option for every mail account to display an
  OSD message when unread mail is present. Pressing OK while the message
  is visible opens the mail account.
  It isn't necessary any more to use the external mailcmd.sh to simply
  display the "new mail in ..." message on the OSD. The feature of the
  external mailcmd.sh is still available and may be used for other ways
  to signal the arrival of new mail, e.g. switching on some LEDs.

- Added new configuration option for every mail account to display the
  number of unseen mails in the main-menu entry of the plugin.

- If necessary the plugin converts the mail (subject & body) using
  iconv from the charset used in the mail to the charset used by vdr.

- Mail parts encoded in Base64 are decoded and displayed.

- The Plugin now queries the width and font of the text area to make a
  nice word-wrapping (especially when wrapping quoted text). To use this
  feature, the skin has to implement the methods cSkin::GetTextAreaWidth()
  and cSkin::GetTextAreaFont() as the standard-skins Classic & ST:TNG
  and the Elchi-skin currently do.

- The mail account passwords are now stored in an obscured way in the
  file accounts.conf.

  Note: There is is no real encryption; it is just to make the passwords
  difficult to read for humans.

  The warning from the README is still valid:

  ATTENTION: The account settings are stored in a plain text file in a
  directory 'plugins/mailbox' below the directory where vdr stores its
  setup files. The file will be created with umask 0x600, therefore
  only the user which executes vdr is able to read this file.

  If you consider this insecure, don't use this plugin.

- Added a key in the Mailbox-View to refresh a single mailbox.

- Added a new OSD-menu to display the communication log for accounts
  which have debugging enabled. The log is reachable in the following
  views:
  - Mailbox-View
  - Configuration of a mail account
  - IMAP folder selection view

- Corrected a bug which caused that sometimes the last lines of mails
  were missing.

- The background check for new mail is now stopped in the cPlugin::Stop()
  method of the plugin (according to the HISTORY of vdr-1.3.20)

- Added a help-screen to all OSD-menus which displays a generated list
  of valid keys/actions. The help-screen is (currently) reachable with
  key 0 (if no element is active, which consumes the key 0).

- Actions that aren't supported for the current account type aren't
  visible (e.g. setting the flag "/FLAGGED" or "/SEEN" for POP3 accounts)

- Key-handling in the configuration menus is now similar to editing
  channels in vdr

- Changed the configuration menus for mail accounts
  - several separate options instead of the long mailbox-string
  - accounts can now be duplicated
  - accounts can be tested directly within the configuration dialog
  - reordering of mail accounts is now possible

- Completely restructured the OSD- and key-handling in all OSD menus.

- Corrected a bug when fetching multipart mails.

- More characters are usable for user name, password and account name.
  (Thanks to Peter Herold for reporting this one.)

- Use proportial font to display the mail text instead of monospaced
  (DisplayMenu()->SetText(..., false))

- When started the Mailbox-View calls Display() before all mail accounts
  are checked - otherwise the status-message ("Checking mailbox xxx")
  is displayed below the main menu of vdr.
  (Thanks to Olaf Henkel for reporting this one.)

2004-05-31: Version 0.3.0

- Supports VDR-1.3.8 and 1.3.9, vdr-versions <= 1.3.6 are no longer
  supported, 1.3.7 not checked (therefore the version bump to 0.3.x)

- Removed the improved word wrapping and the font selection due to the
  changes in OSD-handling (skins) of vdr.

- Corrected an error in decoding encoded words ('=?..?..?=')

- Access restrictions: it is now possible to assign a numerical code to
  every mailbox and to configure if this code is necessary to enter the
  settings or even the mail view.

- Removed the conditional compilation for the ElchiAIO-patch.

- Introduced a small performance improvement when selecting another mail.

- Limited the maximum number of mails to download to a configurable number
  to improve usability with big mail folders (until a 'fetch-mails-on-
  demand' or a 'fetch-only-unread' feature is implemented).
  The default maximum number is 100; 0 disables this feature.
  (Suggested by Frank Herrmann.)

2004-01-24: Version 0.1.6

- Works with vdr-1.3.2, vdr-1.3.2-QuickAIO, vdr-1.2.6 and
  vdr-1.2.6-ElchiAIO3c.

- A separate thread checks for new mail in the background and starts an
  external program if the number of mails has changed since the last check.
  - The interval is configurable in the common settings OSD.
    (0 disables background checking)
  - The background checking must be enabled/disabled for every
    mail account in the account settings
  - The external command is set with the command line parameter
    (e.g. '-m mailcmd.sh') for the plugin.
  mailcmd.sh is a sample bash-script which calls svrdpsend.pl to
  display a message on the OSD.

- Mail-View: Improved word wrapping at OSD boundaries to improve
  readability. There are 4 modes/levels to adjust the word wrapping:
  (higher levels include the lower levels)
  0: wrapping as before
  1: when a quoted line (a line that starts with one or more '>') must
     be wrapped at the OSD boundaries, the same number of quote-
     characters are prepended to the second part of the wrapped line.
  2: Lines that end with 'soft breaks' (SPACE + CRLF) in mail parts
     that have the parameter "format=flowed" set, are treated as
     'flowed lines' and therefore concatenated with the following line
     (see RFC 2646).
  3: Two lines are concatenated if the first line ends with a lower
     character ('a'-'z') and the following line starts with a lower
     character. This also works inside quoted paragraphs.

  The mode for word-wrapping can be globally adjusted in the common
  settings. The default-value is 2 as (the implementation of) this level
  is more or less compliant to a standard.
  The mode can be switched temporarily within Mail-View with the key 0.

- MailList-View + Mail-View: added a second page of buttons to change
  the status flags: Seen, Flagged and Deleted.
  (The flags Seen and Flagged don't work with POP3 accounts)

- MailList-View: display progress in the status line while reading
  mail headers

- Mail-view: the separator lines of multipart mails are displayed in a
  different color and are not wrapped.

- Mail-View: a simple scroll-bar is displayed on the right.

- Mail-View: the number of lines which are scrolled with cursor-up and
  cursor-down is configurable (1..5) in the common settings OSD.

2003-12-25: Version 0.1.4

- Fixed an illegal memory access that produced a segmentation fault when
  pressing Menu in MailList-View or Mail-View.
  (Reported by Peter Siering.)

- Added installation notes for RedHat 7.3
  (Thanks to Malcolm Caldwell.)

2003-12-22: Version 0.1.2

- Inverted the sort order in MailList-View that new mails are at the
  top (configurable) (Suggested by several users)

- Updated the number of new and the total number of mails when returning
  from MailList-View to Mailbox-View.

- Introduced new function "Refresh all" [Blue] in 'mailbox view' to
  refresh the number of new and the total number of mails.

- Use a small font for 'mailbox view', 'mail list view' and 'mail view'
  if vdr is patched with ElchiAIO3c. (configurable)

- Solved a display problem in 'mail list view' where the current mail
  wasn't visible. The patch ./patches/vdr-1.2.6-osdmenufix.diff
  needs to be applied to vdr.
  (The patch also works for vdr-1.2.6 with ElchiAIO3c.)

- Improved the diagnostic output, see the section 'Troubleshooting' in
  the INSTALL file.

- Added the ability to decode encoded-words ('=?ISO-8859-1?Q?...?=')
  in 'Subject' and 'From'-lines.
  (works for all characters of 'ISO-8859-1', almost complete for
  'ISO-8859-15' (8 chars missing), 'Windows-1252' (16 chars missing)
  and the other 'ISO-8559-*' (only first 126 characters supported. All
  other encodings are not touched (~0.5% of all mails to vdr-ml since
  03/2002).

- Improved that parts of the subject are not displayed behind the sender,
  if the subject-string is very long and the sender-string is very short.

- Mail-list-view now displays four imap-state flags 'NFAD' (New, Flagged,
  Answered, Deleted) in front of the subject.

- Removed the '\recent' flag completely (from the OSD), as for POP3
  accounts the \recent flag is always set and for IMAP accounts the flag
  isn't very useful (for reading mails).

- Renamed several classes for a consistent naming sheme (and to be
  consistent with the names in the README).

- Added sections 'Troubleshooting' and 'FAQ' to the INSTALL file.

- Updated/modified the comments for Debian / Gentoo / SuSE
  (Thanks for the feedback).

- Added clarification regarding the compile error about the missing
  linkage.c (Thanks to Mark Crispin).

- Separated the installation instructions from the README into a
  separate file INSTALL.
