Description:

	anthra_1024-skin is a dark, anthracite skin for Klaus Schmidingers VDR (http://www.tvdr.de/).

	The resolution of the skin is 1024x576 (16:9) and it is not scalable.

	Users with FullHD- or HD-Ready-capable hardware should have a look at anthra-Full-HD and anthra-HD-Ready-skins

	e.g. http://vdrportal.de/board/thread.php?threadid=99886
	
	Users with eHD or 4:3-Display should have a look at anthra-SD-skin.

	anthra_1024-skin is designed to work with softdecoders like vdr-xine and xineliboutput via vga2scart.
