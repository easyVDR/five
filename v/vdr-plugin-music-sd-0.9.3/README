This is an audio plugin for VDR.

Forked from MP3-Plugin. Read the README_ORIGINAL_MP3

Copy the whole folder "music-sd" to VDR $PLUGINCONFIGDIR (maybe: /etc/vdr/plugins/music-sd).
If you use another path with flag -C/--config , use the same for coverviewer
or you dont see any covers anymore.



- Edit every script or data in subfolder "data" and "scripts" to your env.

- Check the pathes etc.

- Integrate the symbolfont "fonts/VDRMusicSymbols.ttf" in your system (e.g gentoo: copy to /usr/share/font/corefonts)
