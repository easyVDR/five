VDR Plugin 'skinelchi' Revision History
----------------------------------------

2005-02-15: Version 0.0.1

- Initial revision.
  based on source-code of vdr

2005-02-??
- two patches 1. for epg-progress-bar on MTV - reported from Brougs78
	      2. for hiding menu-entry in menu, when not the default screen

2005-02-26: Version 0.0.1b

- fixed something when use font "FontSml" - reported from Brougs78
- clear palette and fill with colors of theme before drawing channellogo
  (because of this max. possible colors in logos will less then possible on
   hardware)
- fix a crash on my system in combination with sleeptimer-0.0.6, when
  slepptimer will show message "Going to sleep in about one minute"
  in ChannelDisplay -> no message like this will display in ChannelDisplay.
- Added "One area (if possible)" in setup for my testings
- Added one area (scrollarea) to MenuDisplay (to make colors of theme working)
- Added changing of colors (not really useful and very experimental) -> will
  be changed in future. theme where saved under "Elchi-Plugin-change.theme
  on pressed "ok" for leave setup, but plugin uses the changed colors until
  restart of vdr, if you want use the new theme after restart, you must
  select it under setup->osd->theme  (but you must select blind, the
  description is not changed, maybe a way to change it without patch
  of vdr is use of "themes", but not at the moment for me
  (on changing the colors will be there entrys "too many colors" in log)

2005-02-26: Version 0.0.1c

- only a test with videowindow, inspired by plugin "yaepg" and
  http://www.vdrportal.de
- removed one unneeded line (260 in DisplayMenu.c), that overwrite a corner
- show Audio-Track also in DisplayChannel::SetChannel to view it also, when no
  epg is available
- mainmenu-mode selectable ("as setup" or "as plugin")

2005-03-01: Version 0.0.1d

- add a small video-window to menu (selectable - only experimental),
  but does not correkt work in all modes, best is one area, other modes
  doesn't show colors on the scrollbar-area, but the area is defined
  (changing of colordepth has no effekt). video freezes sometimes on switching
  video-mode, but only on screen, switching on same or other channel bring
  video on screen back (like yaepg)
  (on multiarea-mode, maybe the osd lose colors, on my system only a
  driver-reload helps at this moment)
- change mainmenu-mode "plugin" to change menu-mode (videoarea or not)
- change the color-setup, but now is a big area show the new color, will be change
  in future

2005-03-02: Version 0.0.1e (no release)

- define HAVE_YAEPG_PATCH for video-window in MAKEFILE
- bring back color changing, was break in 0.0.1d

2005-03-06: Version 0.0.1f

- add setup-option for display screenshots on left side, when using videowindow
  on singlearea menu (maybe to use this later to show videowindow like osdpip)
  (osd-problems with multiarea menu only when uses screenshots before using
   multiarea-menu or if video freezes after leave the menu) - please report,
   if someone found or know something to make this work)
- some minor changes in setup and DisplayMenu
- add symbols for dvd-replay in DisplayReplay (...4 - ...8) - hope, they are not ugly

2005-03-09: Version 0.0.1g

- add setup-option for show epg4vdr-pictures in egp-window
- define HAVE_IMAGEMAGICK for epg4vdr-picture and video-window in MAKEFILE
  (must uncomment the options you want in makefile)

- VolumeBar now reaches the right side of osd, when volume=100%
- unused text-area in DiplayReplay is redrawned transparent, when SetText is
  called (because i.e. plugin mp3 changes text)
- changed calculation of DisplayTracks, DisplayTracks now also uses
  Setup.ChannelInfoPos
- add colors of MenuItems to 2bit-area of menuitems before draw first pixel to
  avoid flushing-effects -> but color of clrMenuItemNonSelectable now is only
  shown, if this color is the same as clrMenuItemCurrentBg or clrMenuItemCurrentFg
  (doesn't work with videowindow)
- changed handling for show VPS-symbol in DisplayChannel, something was wrong
- changed handling of audiostring in DisplayChannel (thanks to HelAu from
  www.vdrportal.de for reporting problem with vdr on "Dummy Modus")
  (i hope, my changes works - please report, if not)

  failed to load a rich xpm
  (ImageMagick can load other bitmaps, but be aware, vdr will crash if it load
   logo and it isn't a xpm.
   For 8-bit-logo-area with use of ImageMagick the first look is in
   "../hqlogos" from logodir without an fileextention, so make symlinks with
   channelnames to use this)

- extended Recording info of Recordings (channel, cutted/uncutted length, cutted/uncutted size, ...)
- added additional (optional) Infoline for current recordings in DisplayChannel
- scrolling text had a leading and trailing space which makes scrolling look ugly (untidy)

  threads are now started in cPluginElchi::Start() (side effect: changed setup values
  were never saved as VDR crashed at shutdown before saving)

- replaced asprintf ("%s") by strdup
- adapted DisplayChannel to cCharScroll (side effect: no longer delaying displaying of events)
