_Description: Activate firmware loader (BOOTP/TFTP) of VDR vompserver plugin?
 To automatically load the firmware, it has to be made available to the
 Hauppauge MediaMVP device by a BOOTP/TFTP server. The VDR vompserver plugin
 has such a BOOTP/TFTP server, which is disabled by default.
 .
 If you don't use a separate TFTP server, you should activate the built-in
 BOOTP/TFTP Server with this option.
