DESCRIPTION
       VDRSeriesTimer.pl is called out of the epgsearchuservars.conf with some
       parameters.

       It needs VDR > 1.4.0 and epgsearch > 0.9.19.

       This allows you to configure the timer which is set by an
       series-searchtimer.

       Normally, if the EPG contains something like this:

        Title:    The Simpsons
        Subtitle: My Big Fat Geek Wedding

       you will get an Timer like this

        The Simpsons~My Big Fat Geek Wedding

       With this Script you can get this

        The Simpsons~15x17 - 330. My Big Fat Geek Wedding

       or this

        The Simpsons~15.17 My Big Fat Geek Wedding

       or this

        The Simpsons~S15E17 My Big Fat Geek Wedding

       The Script recognize also some multi epiosodes with the EPG-format
       which RTL II uses in germany.

       With

        Title:    Andromeda
        Subtitle: 15. Episode 1 / 16. Episode 2

       you get

        Andromeda~01x15 - 15. Episode 1 / 01x16 - 16. Episode 2

1. Installation
       Copy the Script VDRSeriesTimer.pl somewhere in the $PATH.

       Then edit epgsearchuservars and add one of the following:

       A) If youve extended EPG (tvmovie, hrzu, etc.):

        %Season%=system(/usr/local/bin/VDRSeriesTimer.pl,--title %Title% --subtitle %Subtitle% --episode %Episode% --category %Category% --genre %Genre% --date %date% --time %time% --channel %chnr% --timet %time_lng%)

        %DateVar%=%time_w% %date% %time%
        %SeriesSD%=%Subtitle% ? %Subtitle% : %DateVar%
        %SeriesVar3%=Series~%Title%~%Episodes%. %SeriesSD%
        %SeriesVar4%=Series~%Title%~%SeriesSD%
        %SeriesVar1%=%Episode% ? %SeriesVar3% : %SeriesVar4%

        %Series%=%Season% ? %Season% : %SeriesVar1%

       B) If you dontt have extended EPG with category, genre etc., but the
       episode number, you can use a shorter version.

        %Season%=system(/usr/local/bin/VDRSeriesTimer.pl,--title %Title% --subtitle %Subtitle% --episode %Episode% --channel %chnr% --timet %time_lng%)

        %DateVar%=%time_w% %date% %time%
        %SeriesSD%=%Subtitle% ? %Subtitle% : %DateVar%
        %SeriesVar3%=Series~%Title%~%Episodes%. %SeriesSD%
        %SeriesVar4%=Series~%Title%~%SeriesSD%
        %SeriesVar1%=%Episode% ? %SeriesVar3% : %SeriesVar4%

        %Series%=%Season% ? %Season% : %SeriesVar1%

       C) If you dont have an episode number in EPG:

        %Season%=system(/usr/local/bin/VDRSeriesTimer.pl,--title %Title% --subtitle %Subtitle% --channel %chnr% --timet %time_lng%)

        %DateVar%=%time_w% %date% %time%
        %SeriesSD%=%Subtitle% ? %Subtitle% : %DateVar%
        %SeriesVar1%=Series~%Title%~%SeriesSD%

        %Series%=%Season% ? %Season% : %SeriesVar1%

       In this short version, the script always tries to find an matching sub
       title in the episodes list.

       Then use in the searchtimer the variable %Series% as Path.

       The episode files must have as filename the title of the series with
       the suffix .episodes.

       So for the series The Simpsons, it searches for The Simpsons.episodes.

       The Script allows per default a difference of 20 percent of the title,
       subtitle and the filename.

       1.1 --format

       With --formatprefix <string>, --format <string> and --formatspacer
       <string> you can define how the output should look. The default is:

        "%D~%T~"         for --formatprefix <string>
        "%sx%e - %n. %S" for --format <string>
        " / "            for --formatspacer <string>

       Call "VDRSeriesTimer.pl -help" to see what each variable means.

       You can also change how many zeroes will be prefixed.

        "%s" results in "02"

        "%5s" results in "00002"

       This can be used with %s, %e and %n. Dont try this with %D, %T, %S, %C
       and %G.

2. Episodes file
       The file contains the episodes in the following format. Each field is
       seperated by one tab.

        #Season        Episode Number  Subtitle
        01     1       1       Season one, Episode one
        01     2       2       Season one, Episode two
        01     3       3       Season one, Episode three
        02     1       4       Sesaon two, Episode one
        02     2       5       Season two, Episode two
        ...

       At the beginning of the file you can use some special keywords.  Each
       keyword must begin with "# ".

       Take a look on some of the "ready to use" lists, Webaddress at the end
       of this file.

       2.x Keywords

       Description of the available keywords.

       2.1 SEASONLIST ... /SEASONLIST

       If you dont have a complete episode list but your EPG contains the
       episode number, you can define which season contains which episodes.
       Then this script can calculate the needed data. Episodes, which are not
       in this file will be added.

        # SEASONLIST
        # 1    1       22
        # 2    23      44
        # 3    45      66
        # /SEASONLIST

       The format is <Season> TAB <first episode in season> TAB <last episode
       in season>

       2.5 COMPLETE

        # COMPLETE

       The script assume that the episode list is complete, nothing will be
       changed in the file.

       2.7 SHORT <text>

       This text will be used as series title. So you can use this

        # SHORT DS9

       to get "DS9", if the title in the EPG is "Deep Space Nine"

       You can use your own short title by using a "per series" configuration
       file. See chapter 4.

3. VDRSeriesTimer.conf - The configuration file
       If the configuration file .VDRSeriesTimer.conf in the users does not
       exist, an file with default values named .VDRSeriesTimer.conf will be
       created in your current $HOME.

       Thes settings are:

       ListsDir          = ""

       Path to the episodes list.

       SeriesConfsDir          = ""

       Path where to find the "per series" configuration.

       UseShortTitle     = yes

       Replace the title with the short title found in the "per series" con
       figuration file or the .episodes file.

       Protected         = no

       Dont change any file.

       FormatPrefix      = "%D~%T~"

       Format            = "%sx%e - %n. %S"

       FormatSpacer      = " / "

       Output format.

       Fuzzy             = 0.20

       Fuzzy matching in percent.  0.00 means must match 100%.  1.00 means
       must match 0%.

       Useful is something between 0.00 and 0.25.

       SendEMail         = no

       Send an e-mail if something gets wrong, eg. an epiosde list cannot be
       found.

       EMailTo           = ""

       E-mail recipient.

       EMailSubject      = "Season data missing"

       Subject.

       ChangeEPG         = no

       Add the season data to the epg summary. The script does this via svdrp.

       KeepEPGSubtitle   = yes

       If the subtitle in the episode list differs from the one from EPG,
       dont change it to the subtitle from list.

       CompareSubtitle   = no

       If yes, search the list by comparing the subtitle to get the season and
       episode numbers.

       CompareEpisode    = no

       If yes, search the list by comparing the episode number to get the sub
       title.

       Fallback          = yes

       First, the script tries to compare Subtitle if CompareSubtitle is set.
       If this fails, it fall back to use other information to guess the miss
       ing data.  If you dont want this, set this to no and the script
       returns unknown (?x? - ?.) if the first try fails.

       VDRHost           = "localhost" SVDRPPort         = 2001 SVDRPTimeout
       = 30

       times

       LogFile           = ""

       File to log to.

4. "Per series" configuration file
       If you define the path SeriesConfsDir, you can put there one configura
       tion file per series.

       File needs to be named as the episodes file, but with ".episodes"
       replaced with ".conf", for example: Lost.conf.

       Settings from this file will overwrite the global ones from VDRSeries
       Timer.conf.

       Possible settings are:

       UseShortTitle     = no

       Protected         = yes

       FormatPrefix      = "%D~%T~" Format            = "%sx%e - %n. %S" For
       matSpacer      = " / "

       Fuzzy             = 0.20

       SendEMail         = no

       ChangeEPG         = yes

       KeepEPGSubtitle   = yes

       See previous chapter for description.

       CompareSubtitle   = no

       If yes, search the list by comparing the subtitle to get the season and
       episode numbers.

       CompareEpisode    = no

       If yes, search the list by comparing the episode number to get the sub
       title.

       Fallback          = yes

       If this fails, it fall back to use other information to guess the miss
       ing data.  If you dont want this, set this to no and the script
       returns unknown (?x? - ?.) if the first try fails.

       EpisodeIncrement  = +0

       If the episode number in the EPG isnt correct, you can increment or
       decrement the episode number.  For example, +5 or -5.

       StartWithSeason   = 0

       Start the comaparing with this season number. Needed for "24", because
       there are the same subtitles in each season.
