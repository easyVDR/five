Usage

Remote Control Keys:

Up/Down/Left/Right:    Navigation in the EPG grid
Ok:                    Detailed EPG View of the selected grid
                       2nd Ok closes the detailed view
Red:                   Search & Recording Menu
Green / Yellow:	       Jump channels back / forward
Blue:                  Depends on configured Mode:
                       Default: Favorites Menu, Switch to channel in 
                       detailed EPG View
                       Optional: Switch to currently selected channel
                       Optional: Open detailed EPG view (OK switches
                       then to channel)

Numeric Keys: If Setup Option "Functionality of numeric Keys" is configured
to "Jump to specific channel", the numeric keys are used for channel number
input. If "Timely Jump" is configured, the keys are used as follows:

1 / 3:                 Big jump (default 3h) back / forward in time
4 / 6:                 huge jump (default 24h) back / forward in time
7 / 9:                 jump to previous / next prime time (8pm)
2:                     create or delete instant timer for selected event
5:                     display "search in recordings" menu
8:                     display "search" menu
Exit:                  closes plugin

In Search & Recording menu the following options are available:

- Instant Record: create a timer for the currently selected program. An
  check for timer conflicts will be performed, if a timer conflict occurs,
  the involved timers can be adapted to solve the conflict. Alternatively
  reruns can be searched and used to solve timer conflicts. 
- Delete / Edit Timer: if a timer already exists for the currently selected
  broadcast, this timer can be deleted or edited.
- Timer Timeline: displays active timers per day
- Create Search Timer: create an search timer with epgsearch. The most
  important options can be defined directly in the menu, expert options
  are available via the "advanced options" button.
- Manage Search Timers: edit, delete and check results of search timers  
- Create Series Timer: create a periodical timer for a dedicated time on
  dedicated days.
- Create Switch Timer: create a switch timer for the currently selected
  program.
- Search: search with epgsearch
- Check for Timer Conflicts: check for timer conflicts with epgsearch.
- Search in Recordings: check if a recording already exists for the currently
  selected program.

The search & recordings menu is intended to present a convenient interface
to different VDR core recording features and additional epgsearch features.
The main goal is to reach better usability for "non expert users".

The navigation through the search & recording menu can be done easily with
up/down, left/right and the ok key. In scrolling lists, with left/right
(after the first/last option of the displayed list element is selected) you
jump to the next page of the list. Pressing up on the first / down on the 
last list item jumpps to the end / start of the list.

In the Plugin Setup Menu in Section "Recording Menus and Favorites" you can
choose three alternatives for the option "Folder for instant Recordings":
- "Always use root video folder": the recording will always be placed in the
  video root folder
- "Select from folder list": before creating a timer, you'll get asked in which
  directory the recording should be placed. If the epgsearch plugin is not 
  available, the entries from VDRs <VDRCONFIG>/folders.conf will be used. If
  the epgsearch plugin is available, the more sophisticated epgsearch mechanism
  will be used to identify the possible folders (folders from 
  <VDRCONFIG>/folders.conf and epgsearchfolders.conf and all already existing 
  folders in the video directory).
- "Use fixed folder": the configured folder will always be used. If this string
  is a epgsearch variable ("%variable%"), epgsearch will be used to replace 
  the variable with a concrete folder. All values defined in the epgsearch config
  file "epgsearchuservars.conf" can be used. These variables use the definitions
  from "epgsearchcats.conf". For a detailed description see the epgsearch Manual.
  With that and a with an EPG with detailed information about movies and series 
  it is possible to create sophisticated paths for timers automatically (for 
  instance with series season and episode in the filename).   

For a search timer also all folders and the defined dedicated folder can be used.

Favorites Menu: if configured, the blue key provides a favorite menu. In this
menu the current scheduling ("What's on now") and the next upcomming Shows 
("What's on next") can be listed. Via the Plugin Setup Menu up to four user 
defined times can be configured with a dedicated description (for instance 
"Primetime" for 8:15 pm). These user defined times are also shown as options in 
the favorites menu. Finally all search timers with the option "use as favorite" 
enabled are displayed in the favorites menu. By selecting this entry, all hits
for this search timer are shown.
