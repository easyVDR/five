GraphLCD base package Revision History
--------------------------------------

2011-05-01: branch touchcol, first commit
- glcddrivers changes / enhancements:
  - support for colour bitmap data
  - support for colours either by using pre-defined colour names or 0xRRGGBB / 0xAARRGGBB (though no alpha channel is supported yet)
  - adapted/added methods SetScreen(), SetPixel()-methods in base-class and driver-classes for new colour enabled bitmap data
  - added support for events (supported for now: simple touch events)
  - added support for requesting and setting driver features
  - added GetBackgroundColor(), GetForegroundColor() -> gets default back/foreground colour
  - fixed compiler warnings (missing parameters in printf(), ...)
  - dm140glnk: bugfix: changed type for vendor and product to 'signed'
  - serdisp:
    - added support for touch events
    - cut support for serdisplib version < 1.95 (-> simplifies code)
    - added basic support for GPIs (eg. enable/disable touchpad)
    - rotate only when graphlcd-setup says so
  - UTF8 should work fine but is not tested very well yet
  - vdr 1.3.x should be supported as well but support for it is deprecated and will be removed (-> cleaner code)
- glcdskin changes / enhancements:
  - improved update policies (update only display regions that require update) - w/o this displays like l4m320t would be unusable w/ graphlcd.
  - new objects / attributes / features for skins:
    - increased skin version to 1.1, version info is now verified before loading a skin
    - objects can now trigger actions (eg. when touching an object it may trigger a VDR 'Key'-event)
    - 'scrolltext' is deprecated and is now an aliases for 'text'
    - new object 'button'
    - new attribute 'valign': vertical alignment
    - attribute 'bgcolor': sets background colour for object (whereas 'color' sets foreground colour)
    - new attributes 'alttext' and 'altcondition' for object 'text' (if 'altcondition' is true, 'alttext' is evaluated and used)
    - scrolling/looping attributes for 'text': 'loop', 'scrollmode', 'scrollspeed', 'scrolltime'
    - new attribute 'default' for variables:
      shortcut for <variable id="name" value="value1" condition="somecondition"/> <variable id="name" value="value2"/>:
      <variable id="name" value="value1" condition="somecondition" default="value2"/> 
      this will actually be stored in two variable entries (exactly as in the first version)
    - new entity 'condblock': combines variables that use the same condition
      <variable id="id1" condition="condition1" value="val1"/>
      <variable id="id1" value="valdefault1"/>
      <variable id="id2" condition="condition1" value="val2"/>
      <variable id="id2" value="valdefault2"/>
      can now be simplified to
      <condblock condition="condition1">
        <variable id="id1" value="val1" default="valdefault1"/>
        <variable id="id2" value="val2" default="valdefault2"/>
      </condblock>
      attention: variable-definitions in a condblock must not contain condition-attributes.
  - XML parser:
    - parser method XmlParse() optionally may pass an error string
    - text-objects may now contain combinations of tokens, constants, and variables
    - evaluation of variables in text-objects is now delayed from parsing time to runtime
  - attention: 'condblock' and attributes 'alttext', 'altcondition' are case studies for now and may be removed
- all changes/modifications/improvements that i've missed in this list

2005-09-17: Version 0.1.2
- split off drivers from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD driver library
  (libglcddrivers)
- split off graphics and font handling from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD
  graphics library (libglcdgraphics)
- split off tools from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD base package
- almost completely rewritten graphics and font handling
- added configuration file to hold the driver-specific options
- changed driver interface
- adopted the tools' code to use the new driver and graphics API
- glcddrivers: new driver noritake800 for Noritake 800(A) series
  displays (thanks to Lucian Muresan)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a NULL-pointer exception in cBitmap::DrawCharacter
  when skipPixels is equal to width of the character and SubBitmap
  returns NULL, which was not tested for (thanks to Malte Schröder for
  reporting this one)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a wrong return value in cBitmap::DrawCharacter in
  case skipPixels > 0 which prevented scrolling from working right.
- now compiles with gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.x
- added missing #includes
- new tool showtext: allows showing a text on the LCD, see
  README.showtext for details.
- glcddrivers: fixed a too early port release in sed1330 driver (thanks
  to Matthias Huber)
- glcddrivers: sed1330: added missing horizontal scrolling
  initialization. Now, there should be no displaced display any longer.
  (thanks to Wolfgang Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: Now serdisplib is loaded dynamically using libdl. So, no
  INCLUDE_SERDISPLIB define is needed any longer (thanks to Wolfgang
  Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: fixed gu256x64-3900 driver: Now sizes other than 256x64
  should work. (thanks to Detlef Ruge and Ralf Müller)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::DrawText that prevented scrolling
  from working.
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::SubBitmap.
- glcdgraphics: changed the interface of DrawText and DrawCharacter of

- crtfont: extended it to support the new font attributes
- crtfont: changed file format of description files. Now the font
  attributes are given by its names, p. e. lineheight:20. Look in
  README.crtfont for details.
- new tool genfont: allows converting of true type fonts to GraphLCD
  fonts using freetype2 library. You have to uncomment HAVE_FREETYPE2 in
  Make.config to use it.
- added new fonts verdana and verdana bold in sizes 9 to 29 converted by
  genfont.
- glcdgraphics: Added additional type casts to std::min calls to make it
  compile on x86-64 (thanks to Stefan Bergler).
