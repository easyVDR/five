.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The programs blink(1) and blinkd(8) help you to count or to monitor things like incoming calls on your voice box or incoming faxes\&. E\&.g\&. they blink Scroll\-Lock LED for incoming voice calls and Num\-Lock LED for incoming faxes\&. Normally, all three LEDs (Num\-Lock, Caps\-Lock, and Scroll\-Lock) are handled\&. The blink client will ask the blinkd server to blink the specified LED with the given rate\&.

.SH "BLINKD OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fB\-\-capslockled\fR
Handle the Caps\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, the default is to handle all of them\&.

.TP
\fB\-f \fIt\fR\fR \fB\-\-off\-time=\fIt\fR\fR
Set the off blink time to the value \fIt\fR\&. The unit is one tenth of a second\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Gives a short help on the command line options and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fB\-\-numlockled\fR
Handle the Num\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, the default is to handle all of them\&.

.TP
\fB\-o \fIt\fR\fR \fB\-\-on\-time=\fIt\fR\fR
Set the on blink time to the value \fIt\fR\&. The unit is one tenth of a second\&.

.TP
\fB\-p \fIt\fR\fR \fB\-\-pause=\fIt\fR\fR
Set the pause time between blinking to the value \fIt\fR\&. The unit is one tenth of a second\&.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fB\-\-no\-reopen\fR
Don't allow blinkd to close and re\-open \fI/dev/console\fR all the time\&. This is to prevent disk activity, but may lead to inaccuracy when switching between virtual consoles\&.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-scrolllockled\fR
Handle the Scroll\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, the default is to handle all of them\&.

.TP
\fB\-t \fIn\fR\fR \fB\-\-tcp\-port=\fIn\fR\fR
Use the tcp port \fIn\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Give a short version information and exit\&.
