.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
The programs blink(1) and blinkd(8) help you to count or to monitor things like incoming calls on your voice box or incoming faxes\&. E\&.g\&. they blink Scroll\-Lock LED for incoming voice calls and Num\-Lock LED for incoming faxes\&. Normally, all three LEDs (Num\-Lock, Caps\-Lock, and Scroll\-Lock) are handled\&. The blink client will ask the blinkd server to blink the specified LED with the given rate\&.

.SH "USAGE"

.PP
On Debian GNU/Linux  \fBblinkd\fR is started without any options from \fI/etc/init\&.d/blinkd\fR, unless the system administrator changed this\&. See blinkd(8) for more information\&. If you like to count something, e\&.g\&. incoming calls on your voice mailbox, incoming faxes in your spool or whatever, just write a script, that calls \fBblink \-\-numlockled \-\-rate n\fR for the first thing you like to count and \fBblink \-\-scrolllockled \-\-rate m\fR for the second thing you like to count and maybe \fBblink \-\-capslockled \-\-rate l\fR for the third\&. n, m and l are the current numbers of things you like to count\&.

.SH "BLINK OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fB\-\-capslockled\fR
Use the Caps\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, no other rate value than zero is allowed\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Gives a short help on the command line options and exit\&.

.TP
\fB\-m \fIs\fR\fR \fB\-\-machine=\fIs\fR\fR
Use the machine \fIs\fR, where the keyboard LEDs will blink\&.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fB\-\-numlockled\fR
Use the Num\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, no other rate value than zero is allowed\&.

.TP
\fB\-r \fIn\fR\fR \fB\-\-rate=\fIn\fR\fR
Sets the blink rate to the given value \fIn\fR\&. This can be either a number between 0 and 29, inclusively, or either a + or a \- character, incrementing or decrementing the current rate by one\&. If you specify any other rate than zero, you have also to specify an LED\&.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fB\-\-scrolllockled\fR
Use the Scroll\-Lock LED\&. If none of the three LEDs is specified, no other rate value than zero is allowed\&.

.TP
\fB\-t \fIn\fR\fR \fB\-\-tcp\-port=\fIn\fR\fR
Use the tcp port \fIn\fR on that the blinkd server waits\&.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
Give a short version information and exit\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
An example for the use of blinkd with the vbox program (an ISDN answering machine) is provided in \fI/usr/doc/blinkd/examples/standard\&.tcl\fR\&. Another example for use with the mgetty fax program is provided in \fI/usr/doc/blinkd/examples/new_fax\fR\&.
