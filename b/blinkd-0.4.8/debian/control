Description: Blinks keyboard LEDs e.g. for answering machine or fax
 Blinkd is a client/server pair, that lets the keyboard LEDs
 blink, indicating things like the number of incoming voice
 calls in the voice box or incoming faxes in the spool.
 Because client and server communicate via TCP/IP, they can
 be located on different machines.  Do not use the software
 for vital purposes, as there is no security mechanism.
