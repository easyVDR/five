These are issues that I unfortunately cannot resolve myself:

1. Most important: for usage without script and outfile option:
    DVB monitoring demon helping the program to rewrite the PAT
    (Program Allocation Table) when the external player software
    has chosen a channel which is part of a new transponder.
    At the moment alevt hangs when the transponder is changed by an
    external player software.
    It then can only be stopped via "killall -9 alevt".
    Or you switch it off before every channel change.

2. Graphical menu written in GKT2, to be used in general connection with
    the outfile (-o) option.

3. New BDF fonts for slightly bigger windows.
    Those BDF fonts need to be edited so that they can be transformed by bdf2xbm.
