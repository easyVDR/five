Installation Instructions
*************************

ROXTerm now uses CMake to build and install.

Requirements
************

ROXTerm additionally needs xsltproc (and docbook-xsl if building without net
access), and everything else required to compile an application linked with
vte.

Building with CMake
*******************

Using a separate build directory is recommended:

mkdir build
cd build

To see available build options etc:

cmake --help ..

To configure make:

cmake .. [OPTIONS]

Build step:

make -j 4

(the -j 4 is optional, but recommended for quad core CPUs).

Install:

sudo make install
