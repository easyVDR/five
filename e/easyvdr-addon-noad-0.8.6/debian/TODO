* Is it a good idea to run autoconf in debian/rules? Maybe it's better to live
  with a large diff or dpatch containing the changes in configure?
* Write manpages for scripts in /usr/bin or move scripts to examples
* Change maintainer to Debian-VDR-Packaging-Team and uploader to Alioth
* Merge all the helper scripts into a single script with well documented
  parameters (and a manpage)
