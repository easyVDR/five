# HandBrakeCLI - VdrTranscode shutdown hook script - mango (easyVDR)
# -------------------------
#
# This script checks if HandBrakeCLI is still doing anything, and if so
# advices VDR to try the shutdown again in 5 minutes
#

ps -ae | grep -q HandBrakeCLI

if [ $? -eq 0 ] ; then
  # HandBrakeCLI is still running, so we should defer
  # the shutdown for 5 minutes
  echo "TRY_AGAIN=5"
