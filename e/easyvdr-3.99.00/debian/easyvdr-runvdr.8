.TH easyvdr-runvdr 8
.SH NAME
easyvdrs-runvdr \- starts VDR and reloads the DVB modules in case of errors
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B easyvdr-runvdr
is called by the init-script of vdr. It acts as a watchdog for vdr and will 
reload the dvb-modules and vdr, if vdr exits with an exitcode different from 0.

.B easyvdr-runvdr
will call /usr/bin/vdr and will pass all commandline-options directly to 
/usr/bin/vdr.

.B easyvdr-runvdr
needs to be called by root in order to work correct, because it will try to 
unload/load kernel-modules!
