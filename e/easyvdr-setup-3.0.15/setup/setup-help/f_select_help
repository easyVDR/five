The file-selection dialog displays a text-entry window in which
you can type a filename (or directory),and above that two windows
with directory names and filenames.
 
Here filepath can be a filepath in which case the file and
directory windows will display the contents of the path
and the text-entry window will contain the preselected filename.

Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.
Within the directory or filename windows,use the up/down arrow keys
to scroll the current selection.
Use the space-bar to copy the current selection
into the text-entry window.

Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry window,
entering that character as well as scrolling the directory 
and filename windows to the closest match.

Use a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept the current value
in the text-entry window and exit.

On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are written
to dialog's output.
