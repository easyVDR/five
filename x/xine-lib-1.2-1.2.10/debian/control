 Libxine provides the complete infrastructure for a video/media player. It
 supports MPEG 1/2 and some AVI and Quicktime videos out of the box, so you
 can use it to play DVDs, (S)VCDs and most video files out there. It
 supports network streams, subtitles and even MP3 or Ogg files. It's
 extensible to your heart's content via plugins for audio and video output,
 input media, demuxers (stream types), audio/video and subtitle codecs.
